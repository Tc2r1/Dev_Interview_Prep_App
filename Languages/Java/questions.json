      "question": "What is Java?",
      "details": "Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreading, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991.",

      "question": "What is a Java Virtual Machine?",
      "details": "It is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine.",
      "questionType": "multi",
      "trueOrFalse": false,

      "question": "What is a Higher Order Function?",
      "details": "The result of one higher-order function can be used as the input to another higher-order function. Any time we pass a lambda expression to a method, that method is a higher-order function.",

      "question": "What is an .equals() method in Java?",
      "details": "The (==) equals operator used to compare the equality of the values. But in the terms of object-oriented programming, to deal with the values in the form of objects. And this object may contain multiple types of data. So using the (==) operator does not work with this case. So we need to go with the .equals() method.",

      "question":"In an instance method or a constructor, 'this' is a reference to the current object?",
      "details": "this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor and helps to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name",
