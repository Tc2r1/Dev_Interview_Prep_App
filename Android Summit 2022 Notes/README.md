## This is the root folder you should open with IDE to build the android application

Inside this folder are notes and thoughts written down by various developers on Android Summit 2022. 

Google is returning to in-person Android Dev Summits, with 2022 seeing three events with different session tracks over the course of a few weeks.

The last IRL event was in 2019, with 2021’s being entirely virtual. Android Dev Summit ’22 starts on Monday, October 24 at 9 a.m. PT with a technical keynote that covers the “latest in Modern Android Development, innovations in our core platform, and how to take advantage of Android’s momentum across devices, including wearables and large screens.”
